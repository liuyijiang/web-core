jboss7 上JBoss的7和java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError：com/sun/image/codec/jpeg/JPEGCodec
修改
Changing your runtime environment (to Java 7, for example) is a good way to cause this.
 The basic explanation is that com.sun.image.codec.jpeg.JPEGCodec 
 and related libraries have long been marked as depreciated,
  and you should use the ImageIO library instead. 
  Cold comfort if you are using libraries that you have no control over and 
  can’t do the conversion and re-build them. 
  The quick way to resolve this runtime error in JBoss is to put an 
  entry in the <JBoss-install-diectory>/modules/sun/jdk/main/module.xml file:
  
  
  <JBoss-install-diectory>/modules/sun/jdk/main/module.xml file:
  
  add 
  Note the line path name=”com/sun/image/codec/jpeg” added to the <paths> subtree.
Your stacktrace regarding the com/sun/image/codec/jpeg/JPEGCodec error will be resolved and you will go on your merry way in your deployment.
